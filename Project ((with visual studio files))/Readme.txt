For coming back to main menu from destinations we input EOF(that's ctrl+z for me); 
((I might be wrong with calling ctrl+z exactly EOF but it serves a similair function from what i remember from Kernighan and Ritchie's book)).

When you enter sub menus where it expects you to give a number, it will expect you to give correct input.
(It will refresh until you do so) But if you REALLY want to go back to main menu just do a series of 4xEOF;
