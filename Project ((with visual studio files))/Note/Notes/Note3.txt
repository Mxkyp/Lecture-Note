Predicate Logic: Extends first-order logic and introduces predicates,which are statements 
that may depend on variables.
Set Theory as a Foundation: Set theory serves as a foundational framework for much of mathematics.
Many mathematical structures, including numbers and functions, can be defined in terms of sets.

Together, logic and set theory provide a rigorous basis for mathematical reasoning,
allowing mathematicians to express and manipulate mathematical concepts precisely and systematically.
They are crucial tools for understanding the structure of mathematical arguments
and the relationships between various mathematical objects.
