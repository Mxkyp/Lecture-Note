The project idea:
Create a nice and reliable enviorment for writing, safely storing reading and performing non-destructive edits 
on notes from a certain subject:

I focused on: 
Creating a program that had a very readable implementation, predictible behaviour, and that worked as intended 
and had some nice extras built pretty much from "first principle".

Results: 
((yet to be rated))

Note: Pretty much 95% of the code was enginnered by myself, I learend a few tricks from stack and asked Chat-gpt
a few questions but thats about it. The solutions written are not based on tutorials from geeks,javapoint or 
any other website, but they are the result of my contemplation and my approach at breaking the problem into smaller pieces.

Whenever i used something from the internet or got inspired i tried to write it as explicitly as I can,
  I don't think i omitted anything apart from the fact that i learned about breaking a program into seperate files on Stack.
  And concerning the looks of the main menu i took inspiration from this site that I showed on our lesson;
  https://www.studytonight.com/c-projects/diary-management-system-project-using-c-language
  (I didn't even read the code  there I just remeber that they used some cases or something).
