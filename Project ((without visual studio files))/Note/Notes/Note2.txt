Definition: Set theory is the mathematical study of collections of objects, called sets,and the
relationships between these sets.
Sets:A set is a well-defined collection of distinct elements. Sets are often denoted by curly braces and can be finite or infinite.
Operation on Sets:Common set operations include union (combining sets),intersection
(common elements of sets), and complement (elements not in a set).
Cardinality:The cardinality of a set is the measure of the "number of elements" in the set.
Sets can be equal in cardinality without having the same elements.
